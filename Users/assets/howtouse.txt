# How to Use Assets in This Module

All files placed in this folder are publicly accessible via the following URL structure:

/assets/modules/Users/

For example:
- If you place a file named `script.js` in the `js` subfolder, you can include it in your HTML like this:
  ```html
  <script src="/assets/modules/Users/js/script.js"></script>
  ```

- If you add a file named `styles.css` in the `css` subfolder, you can link it like this:
  ```html
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/assets/modules/Users/css/styles.css">
  ```

- If you include an image named `banner.jpg` in the `images` subfolder, you can use it as follows:
  ```html
  <img src="/assets/modules/Users/images/banner.jpg" alt="Banner">
  ```

- If you place a font file named `myfont.woff2` in the `fonts` subfolder, you can reference it in your CSS like this:
  ```html
  <style>
    @font-face {
      font-family: 'MyFont';
      src: url('/assets/modules/Users/fonts/myfont.woff2') format('woff2');
    }
  </style>
  ```
